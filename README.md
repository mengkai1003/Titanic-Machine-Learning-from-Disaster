# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition in Kaggle.com, using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

### 1. Dataset imputation.
### 2. Perform the Data cleaning and Feature Engineering steps for both the train and test files.
### 3. Use the train subset to fit the following models
• KNN

• Support Vector Classifier 

• Logistic Regression

• Random Forest

• Gradient Boosting

(Use GridSearchCV to find best hyperparameter values)
